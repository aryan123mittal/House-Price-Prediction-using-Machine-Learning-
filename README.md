# House-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning


The objective of the "House Price Prediction" project is to accurately estimate home prices based on various
features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, amenities, and other relevant factors. By leveraging machine
learning algorithms, the project aims to provide a reliable pricing model that can assist potential buyers, sellers,
and real estate professionals in making informed decisions.
Tools and Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, NumPy for numerical computations, Scikit-learn for
implementing machine learning algorithms, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
